# Online Change

Online change (hot-reload) allows you to modify a running PLC program's logic
without stopping the scan-cycle engine. The system analyzes compatibility
between the old and new compiled modules, migrates variable state, and performs
an atomic swap.

## Overview

The simplest way to perform an online change is via the high-level API:

```rust
engine.online_change(new_source)?;
```

This runs the full pipeline: parse, analyze, compile, compare modules, migrate
state, and atomic swap. Under the hood, the pipeline consists of three steps:

```
  Old Module + New Source
        |
        v
  ┌─────────────────────┐
  │  analyze_change()    │ ── Compare old and new modules
  │  → Compatible?       │    for structural equivalence
  └──────────┬──────────┘
             │ yes
             v
  ┌────────��────────────┐
  │  migrate_locals()    │ ── Copy variable values from old
  │  → State preserved   │    VM state into new module layout
  └──────────���───────��──┘
             │
             v
  ┌─────���───────────────┐
  │  vm.swap_module()    │ ── Atomic swap of the module in
  │  → Engine updated    │    the running engine
  └─────────────────────┘
```

If the change is **incompatible**, the system reports the reason and the caller
must perform a full restart instead.

## Compatibility Analysis

`analyze_change(old_module, new_module)` compares two `st_ir::Module` values
and returns a `ChangeAnalysis`:

```rust
pub fn analyze_change(old: &Module, new: &Module) -> ChangeAnalysis;
```

### What is Compatible

The following changes can be applied online without stopping the engine:

| Change | Example | Why it works |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Modified program body logic | Changed an `IF` condition or assignment | Same variable layout, only bytecode changes |
| Reordered statements | Moved assignments around | Same variable layout |
| Changed literal values | `limit := 50` to `limit := 100` | Same variable layout |
| Added/removed comments | `(* new comment *)` | No effect on compiled output |
| Modified function bodies | Changed internal computation | Functions are stateless |

### What is Incompatible

These changes require a full restart:

| Change | Example | Why it fails |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Added a variable | New `VAR counter2 : INT; END_VAR` | Memory layout changed |
| Removed a variable | Deleted a VAR declaration | Memory layout changed |
| Changed a variable's type | `counter : INT` to `counter : DINT` | Value size changed |
| Renamed a variable | `counter` to `cnt` | Name-based migration cannot match |
| Added/removed a POU | New `FUNCTION` or `FUNCTION_BLOCK` | Module structure changed |
| Changed function signatures | Added a parameter to a function | Call sites would be invalid |

## Variable Migration

When a change is compatible, `migrate_locals(old_vm, new_module)` copies
variable values from the old VM's memory into the new module's memory layout:

```rust
pub fn migrate_locals(
    old_vm: &Vm,
    new_module: &mut Module,
) -> Result<MigrationReport, MigrationError>;
```

The migration is **name-and-type-based**: a variable in the new module receives
the old value only if a variable with the same name and same type exists in the
old module. This ensures type safety during the swap.

### Migration Report

The migration returns a report listing:

- **Migrated** -- Variables whose values were copied successfully
- **Defaulted** -- Variables that exist only in the new module (initialized to defaults)
- **Dropped** -- Variables that exist only in the old module (values discarded)

## Atomic Swap

`vm.swap_module(new_module)` performs the actual replacement:

1. The engine finishes the current scan cycle (never interrupts mid-cycle)
2. The old module is swapped out and the new module is installed
3. The next scan cycle executes the new bytecode
4. Program locals that were migrated retain their values

The use of `body_start_pc` is critical: it causes the VM to skip the variable
initialization preamble on the next cycle, preserving the migrated values. This
is the same mechanism used for normal scan-cycle local retention in PROGRAMs.

## Code Example: Hot-Reload Workflow

### Original program

```st
PROGRAM Main
VAR
    counter : INT := 0;
    limit   : INT := 50;
    active  : BOOL := FALSE;
END_VAR
    counter := counter + 1;
    IF counter > limit THEN
        active := TRUE;
    END_IF;
END_PROGRAM
```

### Modified program (compatible change)

```st
PROGRAM Main
VAR
    counter : INT := 0;
    limit   : INT := 50;
    active  : BOOL := FALSE;
END_VAR
    counter := counter + 2;         (* changed: increment by 2 *)
    IF counter > limit THEN
        active := TRUE;
        counter := 0;              (* added: reset on overflow *)
    END_IF;
END_PROGRAM
```

This change is **compatible** because:
- The variable declarations are identical (same names, same types, same order)
- Only the program body logic changed

After online change:
- `counter` retains its current runtime value (e.g., 37)
- `limit` retains its value (50)
- `active` retains its value (FALSE or TRUE depending on state)
- The new logic takes effect on the very next scan cycle

### Incompatible change example

```st
PROGRAM Main
VAR
    counter : DINT := 0;           (* changed type: INT → DINT *)
    limit   : INT := 50;
    active  : BOOL := FALSE;
    log     : INT := 0;            (* added new variable *)
END_VAR
    (* ... *)
END_PROGRAM
```

This change is **incompatible** because:
- `counter` changed type from `INT` to `DINT`
- A new variable `log` was added

The system reports the incompatibility and the program must be fully restarted.

## Integration with Monitor Server

Online change can be triggered through the monitor server's WebSocket API using
the `onlineChange` request type. This allows the VSCode monitor panel (or any
WebSocket client) to push new source code to the running engine. See
[Monitor Server](./monitor-server.md) for the protocol details.
