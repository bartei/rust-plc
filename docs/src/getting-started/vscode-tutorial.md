# Editing, Running & Debugging in VSCode

This is a complete walkthrough of writing, running, and debugging an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program in Visual Studio Code using the rust-plc toolchain.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- **rust-plc repository** cloned and built (`cargo build -p st-cli`)
- **VSCode extension** installed (see [VSCode Setup](./vscode-setup.md))
- Or simply use the **Devcontainer** — everything is pre-configured

> **Fastest way to start:** Open the repository in VSCode and click "Reopen in Container". After the container builds, everything is ready.

---

## Step 1: Create a New ST Program

Open VSCode with the `playground/` folder (or any folder with `.st` files).

Create a new file called `my_program.st`:

**File → New File → Save as `my_program.st`**

Paste this code:

```st
(*
 * My first ST program — a simple counter with threshold detection.
 *)

FUNCTION IsAboveThreshold : BOOL
VAR_INPUT
    value : INT;
    threshold : INT;
END_VAR
    IsAboveThreshold := value > threshold;
END_FUNCTION

PROGRAM Main
VAR
    counter   : INT := 0;
    limit     : INT := 50;
    exceeded  : BOOL := FALSE;
    message   : INT := 0;
END_VAR
    counter := counter + 1;

    exceeded := IsAboveThreshold(value := counter, threshold := limit);

    IF exceeded THEN
        message := 1;
    ELSE
        message := 0;
    END_IF;

    IF counter >= 100 THEN
        counter := 0;
    END_IF;
END_PROGRAM
```

### What you should see immediately

As soon as you save the file:

1. **Syntax highlighting** — Keywords (`PROGRAM`, `IF`, `THEN`, `END_IF`) appear in a distinct color. Types (`INT`, `BOOL`) are highlighted differently. Comments are dimmed. String and numeric literals have their own colors.

2. **No red squiggles** — If the code is correct, no error underlines appear. The Problems panel (View → Problems) should show no errors.

3. **Status bar** — The bottom-right of VSCode shows `Structured Text` as the language mode.

---

## Step 2: Explore Editor Features

### Hover for Type Information

Hold **Ctrl** (or **Cmd** on macOS) and hover over any variable or function name:

- Hover over `counter` → shows: `counter : INT` with `Var` kind
- Hover over `IsAboveThreshold` → shows the function signature: `FUNCTION(value: INT, threshold: INT) : BOOL`
- Hover over `exceeded` → shows: `exceeded : BOOL`

### Go to Definition

**Ctrl+Click** (or **Cmd+Click**) on any identifier to jump to its declaration:

- Click on `IsAboveThreshold` in the `exceeded :=` line → jumps to the `FUNCTION IsAboveThreshold` declaration at the top
- Click on `counter` in the `IF counter >= 100` line → jumps to the `VAR` block where `counter` is declared
- Click on `limit` → jumps to its declaration

### Code Completion

Start typing inside the program body. Completion suggestions appear automatically:

- Type `cou` → completion list shows `counter`, `count` (if any), and keywords starting with "COU"
- Type `IF` → completion offers the `IF...END_IF` snippet template
- After a struct variable, type `.` → field names appear (e.g., `myStruct.` shows `x`, `y`, `value`)

**Snippet completions** insert full control structures:

| Trigger | Expands to |
|---------|-----------|
| `IF` | `IF ${condition} THEN ... END_IF;` |
| `FOR` | `FOR ${i} := ${1} TO ${10} DO ... END_FOR;` |
| `WHILE` | `WHILE ${condition} DO ... END_WHILE;` |
| `CASE` | `CASE ${expression} OF ... END_CASE;` |
| `FUNCTION` | Full function template with VAR_INPUT |
| `FUNCTION_BLOCK` | Full FB template |
| `PROGRAM` | Full program template |

### Go to Type Definition

**Ctrl+Shift+Click** (or use the right-click context menu → "Go to Type Definition") on any variable to jump to the declaration of its type. This is especially useful with user-defined types:

- Click on a variable of type `MyStruct` → jumps to the `TYPE MyStruct : STRUCT ... END_STRUCT; END_TYPE` declaration
- Click on a variable of type `MyFB` → jumps to the `FUNCTION_BLOCK MyFB` declaration

This differs from Go-to-definition (which jumps to where the variable is declared) by jumping to where the variable's type is declared instead.

### Signature Help

When calling a function or function block, the editor shows parameter hints automatically:

- Type `IsAboveThreshold(` → a tooltip appears showing `(value: INT, threshold: INT) : BOOL` with the first parameter highlighted
- Type a `,` after the first argument → the tooltip advances to highlight the next parameter

This works for all FUNCTION and FUNCTION_BLOCK calls, showing parameter names and types as you type each argument.

### Find All References

Press **Shift+F12** (or right-click → "Find All References") on any identifier to find every usage in the file:

- On `counter` → shows all lines where `counter` is read or assigned
- On `IsAboveThreshold` → shows the declaration and all call sites

The search is case-insensitive and matches whole words only, consistent with IEC 61131-3 semantics.

### Rename Symbol

Press **F2** on any variable or POU name to rename it across all occurrences in the file:

- Place the cursor on `counter` → press F2 → type `cycle_count` → all occurrences of `counter` are renamed to `cycle_count`

The rename is case-insensitive and applies to all references, declarations, and usages simultaneously.

### Document Symbols (Outline)

Press **Ctrl+Shift+O** to open the document symbol picker, or open the **Outline** panel (View → Open View → Outline):

```
▼ Main (PROGRAM)
    counter : Var : INT
    limit : Var : INT
    exceeded : Var : BOOL
    message : Var : INT
▼ IsAboveThreshold (FUNCTION : BOOL)
    value : VarInput : INT
    threshold : VarInput : INT
```

This shows all POUs and their variables in a navigable tree. Type in the picker to filter by name.

### Workspace Symbols

Press **Ctrl+T** to search for any POU or type across all open files in the workspace. This is useful when working with multi-file projects:

- Type `Main` → shows all PROGRAM/FUNCTION/FUNCTION_BLOCK declarations named "Main" across all `.st` files
- Type `Temp` → finds any POU or type whose name contains "Temp"

### Document Highlight

Place your cursor on any identifier and all other occurrences of that symbol in the file are instantly highlighted with a background color. This happens automatically with no keyboard shortcut needed:

- Click on `counter` → every reference to `counter` in the file lights up
- Click on `exceeded` → all usages are highlighted

This makes it easy to visually trace how a variable flows through your program.

### Folding Ranges

Click the fold icons in the gutter (the small triangles next to line numbers) to collapse code blocks:

- **PROGRAM / FUNCTION / FUNCTION_BLOCK** — collapse entire POU bodies
- **VAR / VAR_INPUT / VAR_OUTPUT** — collapse variable declaration blocks
- **IF / FOR / WHILE / CASE** — collapse control flow blocks
- **Comment blocks** `(* ... *)` — collapse multi-line comments

You can also use **Ctrl+Shift+[** to fold and **Ctrl+Shift+]** to unfold the block at the cursor.

### Document Links

File paths mentioned in comments become clickable links:

```st
(* See utils.st for helper functions *)
// Reference: alarm_logic.st
```

Ctrl+Click on these paths to open the referenced file directly in the editor.

### Formatting

Press **Shift+Alt+F** to auto-format the entire document. The formatter normalizes indentation to produce consistently readable code. You can also right-click and select "Format Document" from the context menu.

### Code Actions (Quick Fixes)

When the LSP reports an undeclared variable, press **Ctrl+.** (or click the lightbulb icon) to see available quick fixes:

- If you type `new_var := 42;` without declaring `new_var`, the diagnostics underline it. Press **Ctrl+.** and select the quick fix to automatically add `new_var : INT;` to the nearest VAR block.

### Diagnostics (Error Detection)

Try introducing an error — change `counter := counter + 1;` to:

```st
counter := counter + TRUE;
```

Immediately you'll see:

- A **red squiggly underline** under `TRUE`
- The Problems panel shows: `left operand of '+' must be numeric, found 'BOOL'`
- A red circle appears on the file tab and in the Explorer

Fix the error to clear the diagnostic.

**Common diagnostics the LSP catches:**

| Error | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Undeclared variable | `x := unknown_var;` |
| Type mismatch | `int_var := TRUE;` |
| Wrong condition type | `IF int_var THEN` (needs BOOL) |
| Missing parameters | `MyFunc()` when params are required |
| Unused variables | Variable declared but never read |
| EXIT outside loop | `EXIT;` in program body |
| Duplicate declarations | Two variables with the same name |

---

## Step 3: Run the Program

### From the Terminal

Open the integrated terminal (**Ctrl+`**) and run:

```bash
# Check for errors (no execution)
st-cli check my_program.st

# Run a single scan cycle
st-cli run my_program.st

# Run 1000 scan cycles (like a real PLC)
st-cli run my_program.st -n 1000
```

**Expected output for 1000 cycles:**
```
Executed 1000 cycle(s) in 1.2ms (avg 1.2µs/cycle, 28 instructions)
```

This tells you:
- **1000 cycles** were executed (like a PLC running for 1000 scans)
- **1.2µs per cycle** — the average execution time
- **28 instructions** — bytecode instructions per cycle

### Understanding Scan Cycles

In a real PLC, programs execute in a continuous loop called the **scan cycle**:

```
┌─────────────┐
│ Read Inputs │ ← from sensors, switches
├─────────────┤
│ Execute     │ ← your ST program runs here
│ Program     │
├─────────────┤
│ Write       │ ← to motors, valves, lights
│ Outputs     │
└─────┬───────┘
      │ repeat
      └───────→ back to top
```

The `-n 1000` flag simulates 1000 iterations of this loop. Global variables (`VAR_GLOBAL`) persist across cycles, so a counter increments each time.

---

## Step 4: Debug the Program

### Start a Debug Session

1. **Open** `my_program.st` in the editor
2. **Set a breakpoint** — click in the gutter (left margin) next to line `counter := counter + 1;`. A red dot appears.
3. **Press F5** or click **Run → Start Debugging**
4. If prompted, select **"Debug Current ST File"**

### What Happens

The debugger:
1. Compiles `my_program.st` to bytecode
2. Starts the VM paused on the first instruction
3. Shows the **Debug toolbar** at the top of the editor:

```
  ▶ Continue  ⏭ Step Over  ⏬ Step Into  ⏫ Step Out  🔄 Restart  ⏹ Stop
```

The editor highlights the current line (typically the first executable statement) with a yellow background.

### Debug Controls

| Button | Keyboard | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| ▶ Continue | `F5` | Run until next breakpoint (across scan cycles, up to 100,000) |
| ⏭ Step Over | `F10` | Execute one statement, skip into function calls |
| ⏬ Step Into | `F11` | Execute one statement, enter function calls |
| ⏫ Step Out | `Shift+F11` | Run until current function returns |
| ⏹ Stop | `Shift+F5` | End debug session |

### PLC-Specific Debug Toolbar Buttons

The VSCode extension adds 4 PLC-specific buttons to the debug toolbar:

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Force** | Force a variable to a specific value (overrides program logic) |
| **Unforce** | Remove the force override from a variable |
| **List Forced** | Show all currently forced variables and their values |
| **Cycle Info** | Display scan cycle statistics (count, timing) |

You can also use these via the **Debug Console** by typing evaluate expressions:

```
force counter = 42
unforce counter
listForced
scanCycleInfo
```

### Inspect Variables

While paused, look at the **Variables** panel on the left (Debug sidebar):

```
▼ Locals
    counter    0    INT
    limit      50   INT
    exceeded   FALSE BOOL
    message    0    INT
▼ Globals
    (empty — no VAR_GLOBAL in this program)
```

The values update as you step through the code.

### Step Through Code

1. Press **F10** (Step Over) — the highlighted line advances to the next statement
2. After stepping past `counter := counter + 1;`, check the Variables panel:
   - `counter` now shows `1`
3. Press **F10** again — steps to the `exceeded := IsAboveThreshold(...)` line
4. Press **F11** (Step Into) — enters the `IsAboveThreshold` function body
5. The **Call Stack** panel shows:

```
▼ PLC Scan Cycle
    IsAboveThreshold    line 10
    Main                line 24
```

6. Press **Shift+F11** (Step Out) — returns to `Main`
7. Press **F5** (Continue) — runs until the breakpoint is hit again (next scan cycle)

### Watch Expressions

In the **Watch** panel, click `+` and type a variable name:

- Type `counter` → shows the current value
- Type `exceeded` → shows `TRUE` or `FALSE`

The watch panel evaluates variable names against the current scope (locals first, then globals).

### Breakpoint Features

- **Toggle breakpoint**: Click the gutter or press **F9** on a line
- **Remove all breakpoints**: Run → Remove All Breakpoints
- **Conditional breakpoints** are not yet supported (future feature)

### Debug a Program with Global Variables

Create `counter_demo.st`:

```st
VAR_GLOBAL
    total_cycles : INT;
END_VAR

PROGRAM Main
VAR
    x : INT := 0;
END_VAR
    total_cycles := total_cycles + 1;
    x := total_cycles * 2;
END_PROGRAM
```

Debug this file and use **Continue (F5)** multiple times. Watch `total_cycles` increment in the Globals scope each time the program completes a cycle and restarts.

---

## Step 5: Debug a Multi-POU Program

The debugger supports stepping into function calls across POUs.

Open `playground/06_full_demo.st` and set a breakpoint inside the `CASE state OF` block. Press F5 to start debugging:

1. The program stops on entry
2. Press **F5** to continue — it hits your breakpoint
3. Check the **Variables** panel to see all local variables and their current values
4. Step through the state machine logic
5. Use **Step Into (F11)** when a function like `Clamp(...)` is called to enter it

### Call Stack Navigation

When stopped inside a nested function call, the **Call Stack** panel shows all active frames:

```
▼ PLC Scan Cycle
    Clamp              line 32    ← current position
    BottleFiller       line 112   ← caller
```

Click on `BottleFiller` in the call stack to view the caller's local variables and source position.

---

## Step 6: PLC Monitor Panel

The Monitor Panel provides a live dashboard for observing and controlling PLC variables in real time while the program runs.

### Open the Monitor Panel

1. Open the **Command Palette**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS)
2. Type and select: **"ST: Open PLC Monitor"**
3. A webview panel opens showing all variables with live values

The monitor connects to the runtime via a WebSocket server that streams variable state after each scan cycle.

### Monitor Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Live variables | All global and program-local variables update in real time |
| Force variable | Right-click a variable to override its value (useful for testing) |
| Unforce variable | Remove the override and let the program control the value again |
| Trend recording | Watch how variable values change over time |

### Forcing Variables

Forcing is essential during commissioning and testing. When a variable is forced:

- The forced value is written at the start of each scan cycle, overriding program logic
- A visual indicator shows which variables are currently forced
- Use "Unforce" to release the variable back to normal program control

### Online Change via the Monitor

The monitor server's WebSocket API also supports **online change** (hot-reload). When you modify and recompile a source file, you can push the new module to the running engine without stopping it:

- Compatible changes (e.g., modified logic, same variable layout) are applied instantly
- Variable values are automatically migrated to the new module
- Incompatible changes (e.g., added/removed variables, changed types) require a full restart

This enables an iterative development workflow where you can edit program logic and see the effects immediately in the monitor panel, without losing runtime state.

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to start ST language server"
- Build the CLI: `cargo build -p st-cli`
- Check the setting `structured-text.serverPath` points to the built binary

### Breakpoints appear as gray circles (unverified)
- The line may not correspond to any executable bytecode instruction
- Try setting the breakpoint on an assignment or function call line instead of a `VAR` declaration or `END_IF`

### No syntax highlighting
- Check the status bar shows "Structured Text" (not "Plain Text")
- If not, click the language mode and select "Structured Text"
- Reload the window: **Ctrl+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window"**

### Debug session ends immediately
- Ensure the file has a `PROGRAM` POU (not just functions/FBs)
- Check the terminal for compilation errors

### Variables show `<unknown>`
- The variable may be out of scope
- Step into the function where the variable is declared
